                        <p class="text-white mb-4">What does? Practice.</p>

                        <p class="text-white mb-4"><span class="key-point">The right kind of practice</span>. Conscious, mindful practice done well.</p>

                        <p>When you’re really good, you can just predictably write the code. You don’t wait for inspiration. You just do it.</p>

                        <p>When a problem comes up at work and a <span class="key-point">prototype would show the right answer?</span> You can just write one. Need to verify a design choice or test out a data architecture? Boom, do it.</p>

                        <p>How do you get that good? The right kind of practice.</p>

                        <p>What’s the right kind of practice? That’s what this book is about.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">But I Already Do Coding Exercises!</h2>

                        <p>
                            Yeah, you do. Me too. And they require somebody to have worked them out in advance. But they really only work once for each exercise, so you constantly need new ones. And you can’t tell in advance if the one you’ve found is any good. <span class="key-point">You hope you’re getting Sandi Metz’s “99 Bottles of OOP,” but usually you’re getting the “Coding Challenge of the Week”</span> to do some little math problem. There’s a reason 99 Bottles costs money - I can’t name a second set of exercises that good. Can you?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You need practice that you can just do right now without hoping Google will be your tutor.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Exercises are fine. But the magic happens when you stop doing somebody else’s exercise and you do the things you care about, that give you the skills you want. That’s the whole purpose.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">But I Practice At Work!</h2>

                        <p>
                            Yeah, you do. I do too. And your coworkers argue constantly about what project to do, and what language or tool to use for it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That’s because the kind of work the business wants is different from the kind of work that makes you better, faster. And the kind of work you need is different from the kind of work that other developers need.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If your job was going to give you the right practice, you’d have to win those arguments. You would have to get good at politics, to win those arguments, to get the kind of practice you need… And you’ll always worry that you’re doing worse work for the business because you’re prioritising your learning over their money.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="key-point">I don’t want to spend my time at work winning at politics. Do you?</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There’s a way around that.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Heck, <span class="key-point">if you tell your employer you’re buying this book to get better at coding, they will probably be thrilled to pay for it</span>. Do you know how much it costs them when you get stuck for a couple of days? I sell a lot of books that employers cheerfully pay for. Businesses like it when their employees get better at coding.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">But How Does a Book Do That?</h2>

                        <p>
                            I’ve written blog posts and spoken at RubyConf on this topic. The short version is that there are some excellent exercises I’ve adapted from non-computer disciplines. They’re not common for software yet, but they really should be - I hope in a few years they’ll be common.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The book <span class="key-point">introduces a type of programming exercise that doesn’t require an expert to set it up for you</span>. I call my version a “Coding Study.” It can be used with any computer language or library you like. It works great alone or pairing. There are simple steps to start a coding exercise on any topic. I also give guidelines, examples and advice so you can learn even more rapidly.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Then you have to practice a lot. But you’ll learn faster than you could without coding studies. The book can only tell you how to practice.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span class="key-point">Don’t buy the book if you’re not planning to do the exercises.</span>
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">What If It Doesn't Work?</h2>

                        <p>
                            If you do the exercises and you don’t improve rapidly, you should ask for a full refund. I sell through Gumroad, which makes refunds quite easy, and I’m happy to do it. <span class="key-point">If you don’t improve, I don’t want your money</span>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you can write basic code in a language of your choice, the book isn’t too advanced for you. It’s not likely to be too simple for you — I use this technique with great success and I’ve been a professional programmer for around 30 years.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The code samples are in Ruby. If looking at Ruby makes you itch, the book may not be right for you. But the Ruby code is not particularly complicated.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I assume you want to get better at the skill of coding. This isn’t guaranteed to get you a job, teach you algorithm design or help you with interviewing. Those are different skills. Being better at coding may help your career — or it may not. I get better at coding because I love it, and I advance in my career even though sometimes I hate it. They’re different.
                        </p>

                            <li>Everything in one place without having to click around and put it together for yourself</li>
                            <li>Save a bunch of time</li>
                            <li>Plans about how to build practice on practice into a coherent program</li>
                            <li>You paid, so you feel like you have to do the exercises - and the book doesn’t work unless you do them</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            None of this is magic. None of it is rocket science. All of it is convenience or commitment, which you could get by just doing more work or having more discipline. Because you’re here, you don’t think that's enough. It isn’t enough for me personally - <span class="key-point">I pay for books and classes regularly so I can learn faster</span>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you believe that paying for the book is robbery when you could just spend hours combing through blog posts (mine and others,) taking notes and collecting examples… You may not be interested in buying this book. Or most other books.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you believe you should do all of that on work time, please keep in mind what your time costs your business. Four or five hours of your salary is usually far more than this book costs.

                             I think that Software Technique is a really important concept, and I've been recommending Mastering Software Technique to my co-workers a lot. The only reason I haven't listed it as a "most important book ever" yet is that I've already had a pretty experimental approach to learning, so MST feels more of a refinement of how I've tended to approach learning, rather than a sea change as such." <br/><br/>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Why You Should Expense Mastering Software Technique?</h2>
                <p>
                    You're a software developer. Your time is expensive. If you don't live in the USA, Mastering Software Technique still only costs several hours of your salary &mdash; in the United States, the plain ebook may cost around <a href="https://codefol.io/posts/fully-loaded-engineer-hours/" target="_blank">fifteen minutes of what the business actually pays to keep you</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If MST makes you just two percent better at what you do in Rails and you stay with your current employer for just two more months, then the book has made a tidy profit for your employer. Each post-MST year you work there (say 50 weeks of work at 40 hours/week) with a two percent improvement saves 40 hours of debugging time to be used on more interesting work, or makes you 40 hours more effective writing new features. That's worth far more than the price of the book. <span class="key-point">By expensing Mastering Software Technique and reading it, you're doing your employer a huge favour</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To do them even more of a favour, you could pick up a site license (multiple book licenses) and share with your coworkers! I also <a href="https://codefol.io/workshops" target="_blank">teach workshops</a>, both in person and online.
